📂 Project Highlights
1. 📈 AI-Driven Demand Forecasting Engine

An advanced time-series forecasting model designed to predict future sales and optimize supply chain operations.

    The Problem: High operational costs due to stockouts or overstocking.

    The Solution: Implemented an XGBoost Regressor with sophisticated feature engineering (lag features, rolling window statistics, and seasonality analysis).

    Business Insight: The dashboard includes a "Forecast Start" marker and confidence intervals to help managers decide exactly when to reorder stock.

    Tech Stack: XGBoost, Pandas, Plotly, Time-Series Analysis.

2. 🛍️ Strategic Customer Segmentation (RFM & CLV)

A marketing intelligence tool that groups customers based on their transactional behavior.

    The Problem: Low conversion rates from "one-size-fits-all" marketing campaigns.

    The Solution: Utilized K-Means Clustering to segment customers into actionable groups such as VIPs, Loyalists, and At-Risk clients based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.

    Business Insight: An interactive Radar Chart provides a behavioral profile for each segment, allowing for highly personalized marketing strategies.

    Tech Stack: Scikit-Learn, K-Means, 3D Cluster Visualization, Radar Analysis.

3. 💰 Real Estate Valuation Engine

A machine learning tool that provides instant market value appraisals for properties in Istanbul.

    The Problem: Market price uncertainty and slow manual appraisal processes.

    The Solution: Developed a Random Forest Regressor trained on Istanbul's real estate dynamics, considering location, property age, and size.

    Business Insight: The model features a "Feature Importance" analysis, revealing exactly which factors (e.g., District vs. Square Meters) are driving the price.

    Tech Stack: Random Forest, Feature Engineering, Data Storytelling.
